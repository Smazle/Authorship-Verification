_Initial_thoughts_:

1.  As input we are given a set of authors A each author in A has a set of texts
    T. The texts span some period of time where the authors writing style might
    or might not change. We want to classify future texts attributed to some
    author a \in A as either true (written by that author) or false (written by
    someone else). Alternatively we don't want to classify but output a
    probability that the text is written by someone else.

2.  To handle the time over which the texts are produced we could use some sort
    of weighted average of the features extracted from each text. The newest
    text has the most influence on the features chosen for an author while the
    oldest text has much less influence.

3.  It seems like character n-gram frequencies are a simple and effective way to
    extract features from a text.

4.  Couple of different ways to handle the extracted features. We could use
    distance metrics to determine whether or not the correct author is given or
    we could use some machine learning algorithm to classify the extracted
    features.
