PAN \footnote{\url{http://pan.webis.de/}} keeps a collection of shared tasks in
digital text forensics. In 2013, 2014 and 2015 the tasks focused on authorship
verification. In the 2015 task a dataset of authors with a set of texts were
given. Each author had a known text and an unknown text and the task was to
determine which of the unknown texts belonged to the same author as the known
text.
