PAN \footnote{\url{http://pan.webis.de/}} keeps a collection of shared tasks in
digital text forensics. In 2013, 2014 and 2015 the tasks focused on authorship
verification. In the 2015 task a dataset of authors with a set of texts were
given. Each author had a known text and an unknown text and the task was to
determine which of the unknown texts belonged to the same author as the known
text.

\cite{maitra2015} implemented a solution for the PAN 2015 task. They used a
collection of different features extracted from the text. The features were
based on punctuation, sentence length, vocabulary, character n grams and
Parts-of-Speech (POS) tagging. They trained a random forest classifier on the
features extracted and used that to determine whether or not the unknown texts
were written by the author. Their results were not overwhelming and they
commented that deep learning might make their results better.
