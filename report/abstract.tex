    In this report we investigate different methods for authorship verification.
    Authorship verification is the process of determining whether a text is
    written by an author given a set of previous texts written by the author. We
    will implement a select few of the algorithms we investigate. The specific
    algorithms are:

    First, the Delta Method which we use as a baseline for the other methods we
    implement. The Delta Method is a distance based approach that use features
    (vector of numbers) extracted from the texts and a distance metric to find
    the closest author of an unknown text.

    Second, a generalising Random Forest approach is implemented. The method
    encodes features extracted from the texts using a \gls{UBM} and applies the
    random forest to those encoded features.

    Third, the Delta Method is expanded by trying different features and
    distance metrics than used in the original Delta Method.

    Fourth, an Author Specific \gls{SVM} is implemented. The SVM is trained
    using the imposter method. Features are extracted from a set of texts known
    to be written by an author and from a set of similar size of texts known to
    not be written by the author. The \gls{SVM} is then trained on those two
    sets of features.

    For training and evaluation we use two datasets. The datasets are from two
    instances of a yearly competition in text forensics (PAN). Specifically we
    use the dataset from the 2013 edition and the 2015 edition. We obtain the
    third best result on the PAN 2013 task and the eights best result on the PAN
    2015 task.
