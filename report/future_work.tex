\section{Future Work} \label{sec:future_work}

Two of the algorithm we have implemented has only been applied to one of the
two datasets we have worked with. In particular the random forest approach has
only been applied to the PAN 2015 data and the \gls{SVM} approach has only been
applied to the PAN 2013 data. The main reason for that is that the random forest
approach requires a single known text per author and the \gls{SVM} approach
require multiple known texts per author. It would be interesting to apply the
algorithms to the opposite datasets and look at their performance there. We can
transform the dataset with only a single known text to a dataset with multiple
by splitting the known text into a collection of known texts. Similarly we can
transform the dataset with multiple known texts to a dataset with a single known
text by concatenating the known texts. By making those two transformations we
could have run all methods on all data and found results for all of them.
